# Arm-Code

### Introduction
A branch for me to experiment with python in order to build code to control a Rover arm with 3 DOF.

### Overview 
The completed Python application, should connect to the arm via serial and allowed the user to move the goal position of the end-effector by clicking and dragging, or by sending commands from another application running on the same computer
